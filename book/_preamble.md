Are you using GNOME on your Linux system? Or any graphical desktop environment
out there? Well, we all appreciate GNOME and KDE for their ease of use and
intuitiveness, but face it, moving the mouse cursor and navigating by clicking on
folders again and again can be time-consuming!

Luckily, that's not the only option. There's another type of environment for you
to work in. It's where you constantly type on the keyboard to get things done.
And it's **much faster** to perform repetitive tasks, files management, etc. if
you work in such an environment. Well, we've been talking about nothing other
than **the command line**.

We know that you're stoked about upgrading your workflow to a new level. And
that's why we present to you, a Linux command line guide. This guide is intended
for absolute beginners and will go from the most fundamental GNU commands to
advanced compiled command line programs. For each command, we will also
introduce its helpful options.

At a ground surface, this might just look like another Bash or Linux command
line guide on GitHub. However, unlike other guides on GitHub, this one is more
oriented towards beginners, and focus on making good use of commands instead of
just learning a bunch of commands. The guide also contains explanations on some
concepts that are required for GNU/Linux command line users to know before
learning the commands. If you've already learned the concepts and just want a
reference, see [42tm's Bash Reference](http://github.com/42tm/bash-ref).

Although the information contained within the guide was carefully reviewed
before publishing, mistakes are inevitable. We welcome and much appreciate any
contribution. The preferred way to do so is by opening a pull request on GitHub.
You can also suggest new ideas by opening a new issue on GitHub.

Thank you, and we hope you'll enjoy reading the guide and learning the Linux
command line all along.

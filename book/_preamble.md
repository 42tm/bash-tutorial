<h1 align="center">Preamble</h1>

![](../img/prem.jpg)

This is a GNU/Linux bash guide. The guide will go from the most simple commands
to more advanced ones, hence this guide can be used for learning (i.e. education
purposes). New GNU/Linux users who wish to learn Bash commands can take this
guide. For each command, we will also introduce its helpful options.

At a ground surface, this might just look like another Bash guide on GitHub.
However, unlike other Bash guides on GitHub, this one is more oriented towards
beginners, and focus on making good use of commands instead of just learning
a bunch of commands. The guide also contains explanations on some concepts
that are required for GNU/Linux command line users to know before learning the
commands. If you've already learned the concepts and just want a reference, see
[42tm's Bash Reference](http://github.com/42tm/bash-ref).

Although the information contained within the guide was carefully reviewed
before publishing, mistakes are inevitable. We welcome and much appreciate any
contribution. The preferred way to do so is by opening a pull request on GitHub.
You can also suggest new ideas by opening a new issue on GitHub.

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy reading the guide and learning Bash all along.

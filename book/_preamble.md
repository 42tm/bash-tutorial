<h1 align="center">Preamble</h1>

![](../img/prem.jpg)

This is a GNU/Linux bash guide. The guide will go from the most simple commands
to more advanced ones, hence this guide can be used for learning (i.e. education
purposes). New GNU/Linux users who wish to learn Bash commands can take this
guide. For each command, we will also introduce its helpful options.

At a ground surface, this might just look like another Bash guide on GitHub.
However, unlike other Bash guides on GitHub, this one is more oriented towards
beginners, and focus on making good use of commands instead of just learning
a bunch of commands. The guide also contains explanations on some concepts
that are required for GNU/Linux command line users to know before learning the
commands. If you've already learned the concepts and just want a reference, see
[42tm's Bash Reference](http://github.com/42tm/bash-ref).

Tags Glossary
=============

This document contains a table with all the tags presented in the Bash guide
along with their descriptions. The tags' names appear in the table are sorted
alphabetically, from A to Z. In the guide document (README.md), each tag appears
to have a hash tag symbol ("#") as its first character. The hash tag symbols,
however, are not part of the tags' names and they appear so that the viewers can
conveniently search & find by tags. The hash tag signs are omitted in the below
table.

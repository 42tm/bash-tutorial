Description
-----------

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Bash guide and all the resources
used by the guide. Understanding of the most basic computer concepts (e.g. file,
folder, program) is the only prerequisite for taking this guide, although
besides that, you should also have a GNU/Linux distribution installed (either
on your computer's disk or in a virtual machine) so that you can learn by doing.

the basic stuff.

programming "using only built-in `bash` features".

is more of a reference because the explanations are short and some (if not all)
technical terms are not explained.

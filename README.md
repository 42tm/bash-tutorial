Introduction
------------

This is a GNU/Linux bash guide. The guide will go from the most simple commands
to more advanced ones, hence this guide can be used for learning (i.e. education
purposes). New GNU/Linux users who wish to learn Bash commands can take this
guide. For each command, we will also introduce the helpful options.

At a ground surface, this might just look like another Bash guide on GitHub.
However, you will see the difference as you go along. Let's get started.

both Bash commands and Bash programming. However it assumes that you already
knew the basic stuff.
- [**Pure Bash Bible**][rr2] by [**dylanaraps**][rra2]: A document focused on
Bash programming "using only built-in `bash` features".
- [**42tm's Bash Reference**][rr3] by [**42tm**][rra3]: A reference for Bash
from 42tm that gets upstreamed with 42tm's Bash Guide.
- [**`bash-guide`**][rr4] by [**Idnan**][rra4]: A supposedly guide for Bash,
however it is more of a reference because the explanations are short and some
(if not all) technical terms are not explained.

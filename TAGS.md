<h1 align="center">Tags Glossary</h1>

<p align="center">
    This document contains a table with all the tags presented in the Bash guide
    along with their descriptions. The tags' names appear in the table are
    sorted alphabetically, from A to Z. In the actual, each tag appears to have
    a hash tag symbol ("#") as its first character. The hash tag symbols,
    however, are not part of the tags' names and they appear so that the viewers
    can conveniently search & find by tags. The hash tag signs are omitted in
    the below table.
